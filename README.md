This is customized from [CartONG/mapathon_dashboard](https://github.com/CartONG/mapathon_dashboard).


This tool allows you to monitore an OpenStreetMap Mapathon based on a Tasking Manager Project.
Just entre the #id of the task and the start date and time of the event and see how many buildings have been digitalized, how many kilometers of raods and kilometer square of landuse.
