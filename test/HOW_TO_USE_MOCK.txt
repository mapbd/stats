1 - You will have to make the following import in the "store.ts" file [The file name can be different, it depends on the file you want to use] :
  import { STATE } from '../test/state_project_8247_saved'

2 - You need to comment a line of code of "store.ts" file number 106 :
  QueryProject.requestProjectData();

3 - You need to copy/paste the following lines of code in the "store.ts" file after the line commented previously :
  this.state.projectId = parseInt(STATE.projectId);
  this.setProjectNameCentroidAndPercentages(STATE.projectName, STATE.percentMapped, STATE.percentValidated, STATE.aoiCentroid as Point);
  this.setProjectBoundingBox(STATE.areaOfInterest as MultiPolygon);
  this.setChangeSets(STATE.changeSetsIds);
  this.setFeaturesData(STATE.osmData.building as FeatureCollection<Geometry>,
    STATE.osmData.highway as FeatureCollection<Geometry>,
    STATE.osmData.landuse as FeatureCollection<Geometry>,
    STATE.osmData.waterway as FeatureCollection<Geometry>);
  this.state.projectLoaded = true;
  this.state.updateTime = moment();

4 - Now if you look at your "store.ts" file, it should be like so:
START OF FILE
[...]
import { State } from './classes/state'

import { STATE } from '../../test/state_project_8247_saved.ts'

import { FeatureCollection, Geometry } from 'geojson';

//Constant to expose and manage the store
[...]
setSearchBarValues(projectId: number, chosenServer: string)
  {
    this.state.projectId = projectId;
    this.state.chosenServer = chosenServer;
    //Check if a timeout already exists
    if(this.state.timeoutId != -1)
    {
      //Clear the timeout
      window.clearTimeout(this.state.timeoutId!);
    }
    this.state.timeoutId = -1;
    //Request for project data
    //QueryProject.requestProjectData();
    this.state.projectId = parseInt(STATE.projectId);
    this.setProjectNameCentroidAndPercentages(STATE.projectName, STATE.percentMapped, STATE.percentValidated, STATE.aoiCentroid as Point);
    this.setProjectBoundingBox(STATE.areaOfInterest as MultiPolygon);
    this.setChangeSets(STATE.changeSetsIds);
    let featuresData = new FeaturesData();
    featuresData.setFeatures(STATE.osmData.building as FeatureCollection<Geometry>,
      STATE.osmData.highway as FeatureCollection<Geometry>,
      STATE.osmData.landuse as FeatureCollection<Geometry>,
      STATE.osmData.waterway as FeatureCollection<Geometry>);
    this.setFeaturesData(featuresData);
    this.state.projectLoaded = true;
    this.state.updateTime = moment();
  },
  updateProjectLoaded()
  [...]
